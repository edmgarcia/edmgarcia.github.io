				<p>Learning programming is fun, but creating a game is more fulfilling! Just a month before posting this blog, I was just another user or a gamer. I never thought that I could create a simple but fun web game made only with pure JavaScript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="blog--panel">
				<p><a href="https://www.upliftcodecamp.com/" class="text-link">Uplift Code Camp</a>, a bootcamp institution in the Philippines that helps a no-programming-knowledge like me to learn programming one syntax at a time.</p>
					
				<p>I still remember the day that I've read a post from Uplift regarding a scholarship. This scholarship will grant you a ticket to be part of their new batch, a batch of aspiring website developers.</p>
					
				<p>Luckily, I was one of the ten who got the ticket. I was very happy, but I was like, <i>"programming, please be easy on me."</i></p>
					
				<p>The journey of learning how to program is twice as hard as I initially imagined. There were terms and words that new to my ears. Not to mention the syntax that was not making sense to me.</p>

				<p>Honestly, I was having a hard time coping up at first, but the <i>programmer-spirit</i> in me is stronger than my laziness. LOL!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="blog--panel">
				<p>After a ton of discussions about syntax, arrays, objects, and functions, finally, I was able to understand how programming really works.</p>

				<p>Programming is not a rocket-science (as I thought of) afterall.</p>
				
				<p>Here's one of the fruits of my labor, I created a simple but fun game just for you. Made with nothing but HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript.</p>

				<p>I hope you enjoy it. Launch the game here <a href="https://edmgarcia.github.io/unzooom.html" class="unzooom-link">Unzooom!</a></p>
