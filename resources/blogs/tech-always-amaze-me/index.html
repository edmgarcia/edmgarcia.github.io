				<p>Ever since high school, I've always been fascinated about how technology help ease people's lives. And not so long ago, we were used to playing CDs at home, we were lucky to get at least 50 kbps internet speed, and worse, you can't erase a misspelled word on a typewriter.</p>

				<p>We've all seen the technology unfolds before our very eyes, and these innovations sparked the tech spirit in me.</p>
					
				<p>I was a factory worker for Unilever Philippines when I first held a cellphone -- it was in 2001. I was amazed how we can send a text message and talk to someone from half way across the globe with a single push of a button. Since then, my dream to be working in the tech industry skyrocketed.</p>
					
				<p>After over a decade working as a support for some IT companies, my dream of becoming a programmer never left me. I've been self studying website development in my free time, watched numerous hours of YouTube tutorials, and countless sleepless nights of practice.</p>
					
				<p>The joy and amazement when I see how the HTML button tag becomes a real virtual button on the browser is still the same feeling when I first sent my very first text message from a cellphone over 20 years ago.</p>
